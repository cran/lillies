\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe, where each raw represents an age, for the population of
interest. The dataframe will contain information on age-specific mortality rates
or survivial probability (if both parameters are provided, rates will be used).}

\item{age}{Variable in \code{data} containing information on age.}

\item{rates}{Variable in \code{data} containing information on age-specific mortality rates.}

\item{surv}{Variable in \code{data} containing information on age-specific survival probability.}

\item{weights}{Variable in \code{data} containing information on number of new cases per age. A
weighted average is provided using these weights.}

\item{data0}{A dataframe, where each raw represents an age, for the population of
reference The dataframe will contain information on age-specific mortality rates
or survivial probability (if both parameters are provided, rates will be used).}

\item{age0}{Variable in \code{data0} containing information on age.}

\item{rates0}{Variable in \code{data0} containing information on age-specific mortality rates.}

\item{surv0}{Variable in \code{data0} containing information on age-specific survival probability.}

\item{age_begin}{Specific starting age at which the Life Years Lost have to be estimated.}

\item{age_end}{Specific ending age at which the Life Years Lost have to be estimated.}

\item{censoring_label}{Label for censoring status (\code{"Alive"} by default).}

\item{death_labels}{Label for event status (\code{"Dead"} by default).}

\item{tau}{Remaining life expectancy and Life Years Lost are estimated restrictied to a maximum
theoretical age \eqn{\tau} (\eqn{\tau}=100 years by default).}
}
\value{
A list with class \code{"lyl_aggregated"} containing the following components:
\itemize{
    \item{\code{data}: Name of the dataset preovided in parameter \code{data}}
    \item{\code{data0}: Name of the dataset preovided in parameter \code{data0}}
    \item{\code{LYL}: Data frame with 1 observation and 2 variables: \code{life_exp} and \code{life_exp0} which are the
    estimated remaining life expectancies averaged over the age range
    and before age \code{tau} years for the population provided in \code{data} and \code{data0}, respectively}
    \item{\code{tau}: Maximum theoretical age \eqn{\tau}}
    \item{\code{age_begin}: Specific starting age at which the Life Years Lost have been estimated}
    \item{\code{age_end}: Specific ending age at which the Life Years Lost have been estimated}
    \item{\code{data_plot}: A data frame in long format with 3 variables \code{time}, \code{cause}, and \code{cip} used
    to create a Figure of Life Years Lost with function \code{\link{plot}}.}
    \item{\code{censoring_label}: Label for censoring status}
    \item{\code{death_labels}: Label(s) for death status}
    \item{\code{type}: Whether the estimation is at \code{"age_specific"} or \code{"age_range"}.}

\description{
\code{lyl} estimates differences in remaining life expectancy and Life Years Lost
for two given life tables \code{data} and \code{data0} after a range of specific ages
(\code{age_begin} to \code{age_end}) and restrictied to a maximum theoretical age \eqn{\tau}.
