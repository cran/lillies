\usage{
lyl_diff_ref(
  lyl_population1,
  data_ref,
  age,
  surv,
  rates,
  decimals = 2,
  level = 0.95,
  weights = NA,
  lyl_population0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{lyl_population1}{Population of interest: An object of class \code{lyl} or \code{lyl_range} (obtained with
functions \code{lyl} or \code{lyl_range}). Alternatively, an object of class \code{lyl_ci} can be provided for
bootstrapped confidence intervals.}

\item{data_ref}{A dataframe, where each raw represents an age, for the population of
reference The dataframe will contain information on age-specific mortality rates
or survivial probability (if both parameters are provided, rates will be used).}

\item{age}{Variable in \code{data_ref} containing information on age.}

\item{surv}{Variable in \code{data_ref} containing information on age-specific survival probability.}

\item{rates}{Variable in \code{data_ref} containing information on age-specific mortality rates.}

\item{decimals}{Number of decimals to be reported (default is 2).}

\item{level}{Confidence level if \code{lyl_population1} or \code{lyl_population0} is obtained with the \code{lyl_ci}
function (default is 0.95 for 95\% confidence intervals)}

\item{weights}{Vector with age distribution of disease/condition onset to be used when Life Years Lost are estimated
over a range of ages (with \code{lyl_range} function). If weights are not provided (dafault is \code{weights = NA}),
then the differences in Life Years Lost at each age is provided. If weights are provided, then a weighted average is provided.}

\item{lyl_population0}{Parameter automatically created.}
}
\value{
A table with the summary of the differences between two populations.
}
\description{
\code{lyl_diff} summarizes differences in estimated Life Years Lost
in two different populations: \code{lyl_estimation1} compared to a life table provided in \code{data_ref}.
